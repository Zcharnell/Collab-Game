Current:

-Mountains
-River
-Lake
-Castle
-Hut
-Grass



To-Do:

-Have tile art be dependent on nearby tiles. A lake tile surrounded by lake tiles should look like deep water; a lake tile with a grass tile on a side should have a shore on that side, while a lake tile with a river on a side should look like the river is running into the lake, and a castle on a side should look like the water is crashing against the side of the castle. Do this for all types of tiles.

-Make the world isometric (make width greater than height)
	--diagonal isometric could work but would require a more complicated tile selection algorithm due to all lines being diagonal

-Find a better heuristic algorithm, and maybe better A* algorithm in general

-In Unity, make everything a normal 2D then set the camera to give that isometric perspective. This would make coding it a lot easier while keeping the same ideal fake-3D perspective. Or it should, at least.


Current:
--add in a time that the unit stays to collect a resource
--add in combat against hostile creeps
--make a second race that functions independently
--make the races interact (fight mainly)


Kinda Finished:
--Figure out how to cache pathfinding, or not pathfind if the end tile is still the same


Completed:
9/1/14--Make a second unit that can also gather and build, while communicating with the other unit
9/1/14--make workers return resources if there is only one resource on screen and another worker is going for it
